# cryptoblaxter

**Abstract**

This project attempts to model the world of cryptocurrencies with statistical methods and machine learning.  Specifically,
I will attempt to compare and contrast multiple currencies one as leading and one as lagging indicator to see will we be able
to predict the future prices of several currencies

**Model**

**Statistics**

I will begin with a basic regression model between two variables and see can I find a relationship between two currencies.
After a specific relationship is found, the program will execute trades automatically in the market.  With a model that results
in a positive expectation of any trade transactions, with given enough time and trade volume, due to the laws of large numbers,
we will result in more profit than losts.  When that happens, we can annouce cryptoblaxter is complete ready to be rolled out
for executions

**Machine Learning**

Will use machine learning over time to track any variables that I could have missed and decrease noise in our model

**Background/Tools**

-To fully understand or even extend from this project, I will recommend familarity with the following

**Technologies**

pandas
matplotlib
coinbase (for trade execution)
postgresql

**Statistical Methods**

Regressions
Time Series
Machine Learning
Deep Learning?
